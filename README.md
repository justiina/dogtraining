This is a dog training diary mobile app created using React Native. User authentication is done by Firebase Authentication and the training data are saved to and fetched from Firestore Database. For now, user can only select from three dog sports disciplines (tracking, searching and search and rescue (SAR)), but this number can be increased later.

To use the app, you must obtain the .env file from the developer. Once obtained, the app can be installed by:
1.	Clone the git repository by `git clone https://github.com/justiina/dogtraining.git`
2.	Go to the cloned folder and in the terminal, run `npm install` and start your expo device by `npm start`

Here are the screens of the app:
